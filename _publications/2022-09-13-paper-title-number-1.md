excerpt: 'This work uses text mining (TM), natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization methods to provide a semi-automated rapid literature review and identify how justice courts and legal practitioners may use AI to retrieve similar cases. Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), automation techniques were used to expedite the literature review. In this study, we confirmed the feasibility of automation tools for expediting literature reviews and provided an overview of the current research state on legal precedents retrieval.'
