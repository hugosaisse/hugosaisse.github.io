collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-10-26-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This review article dives deep into the evolving landscape of automating the identification of legal precedents. It describes details of two "eras" of precedent retrieval automation, spotlighting the revolution powered by natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) until the use of Transformers. We also described the usual ML pipeline for precedent retrieval, the multiple techniques used, the data and geographies involved, and proposed a taxonomy for this field. A gap in validation and real-world deployments became evident, and a key question echoes: will courts of justice transform precedent searches through automation?'
