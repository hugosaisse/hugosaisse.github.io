excerpt: 'Assessing the decisions made by regulatory bodies and courts is pivotal, given the vast influence they hold on the people. While machine learning (ML) may be used to predict such decisions, prevalent studies often overlook factors like consistency, real-world applicability, generality, and explainability. Our research introduces a unique two-stage cascade classifier model that harnesses both textual features and metadata from proceedings to improve performance. Utilizing the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) mechanism, our model remains transparent and explainable. With our approach, we've achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.900, outstripping baselines.'
