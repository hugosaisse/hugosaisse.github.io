I'm Hugo, a Ph.D. Candidate at Nova Information Management School in Lisbon, Portugal. My Ph.D. project focuses on automating the retrieval and visual presentation of legal precedents.

Currently, I'm investigating the effects of summarization on the quality of embeddings for textual similarity assessment.
